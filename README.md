<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. For most of us we just want the stable build. So go to releases page.</p>

<p>2. Download the version that you want to use like 5.3 version.</p>

<p>3. Put it in the Plugins folder of your project</p>

<p>4. Build and you should be good to go!</p>

<h2>🍰 Contribution Guidelines:</h2>

Being a open-source project it's important for the people to contribute to the plugin. The only guideline is to include all headers because 5.3 has a lot of issues with headers xD
